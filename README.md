# Group Chat Bot
This GroupMe bot is mainly just to send out automated sober monitor information so people don't have to check the list manually every weekend. The app is hosted through Heroku. It uses the GroupMe API and a Node.js server to read information from a group message and respond with information when certain commands are called.

*Disclaimer: This repository was transfered to GitHub after previously being held in Heroku CLI*
